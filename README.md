Implementation of a Ternary Search Tree in Python

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Ternary Search Tree (TST)** in Python. The TST supports three main operations:
- **Insert**: Adding a word to the tree.
- **Search**: Searching for a word in the tree.(@marilia to review and make any corrections)
- **Delete**: Removing a word from the tree (to be implemented).
- **transverse**:This method method that returns all words in the tree in lexicographical order(to be implemented).

## Current Status (Feature Update)
- **Feature Added**: Insert and Search methods have been implemented.
- **Testing**: Manual testing has been conducted for both insert and search functionalities. The tests have confirmed that words such as "cat", "cap", "bat", "car", and "ca" are being correctly inserted and found.
- **Next Step**: Once the code is reviewed, the delete functionality will be added, and further testing will be conducted.

### Manual Test Results:
- Words inserted: 
  - "cat"
  - "cap"
  - "bat"
  - "car"
  - "ca"
- All words were found successfully.
